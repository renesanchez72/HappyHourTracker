## Description
___
During the week I often decide to go out and treat myself at a local bar, pub, or restaurant for some food and drinks. While I love wining and dining in Chicago, it can weigh pretty heavy on the wallet after a while. The solution? Happy hour. 

There's not much better than enjoying delicious food and drinks, except for getting that same experience at a discounted price! In order to keep track of all of the great deals Chicago has to offer, I created a full-stack application.

Happy Hour App is a MERN application that allows users to retrieve information about happy hours and happy hour deals in the database, as well as create, update, and delete happy hour information easily so they can spend less time looking up happy hour information and more time enjoying happy hour deals.
